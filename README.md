## üöÄ Featured Projects  

### ü©ª **Thoracic Rangers ‚Äì Emory CXR Embedding Atlas**  
> *Emory AI Datathon 2025*  
Built an **interactive visualization tool** to analyze **chest X-ray embeddings** from the **Emory CXR dataset** using **five foundation models**:
RaD-DINO, MedGemma, CheXagent, MedImageInsight, and BiomedCLIP.

**My Contributions**:  
- Performed **EDA** and sampled **100K images per model**.  
- Applied **UMAP + Cosine Similarity** for **2D dimensionality reduction**.  
- Developed **interactive embedding visualizations** using **Embedding Atlas**.  
- Conducted **subgroup-level analyses** to understand outlier clusters and model differences.

**Key Insights**:  
- Embeddings varied significantly between models ‚Üí **model choice impacts downstream tasks**.  
- **RaD-DINO** and **MedGemma** produced **tighter, well-separated clusters**, while others overlapped more.  
- Subgroup patterns were influenced by **age**, **BMI**, and **clinical labels**, highlighting potential biases.

**Conclusion**:  
An **interactive embedding atlas** helps clinicians and researchers visualize model behavior, identify outliers, and compare subgroup patterns in real time.
